# Frontend challenge (React.js)


Mosaic layout. I developed it with React


## Features of this app
- Responsive mosaic layout
- Layout filled with a group of cards
- When you press the button more cards populate within layout
- When layout is filled button is dissapper


## How I Created The App
- I used useEffect() hook, to put API data into state
- I used useState() hook, to updating state objects with nested arrays of objects 
- I used conditional rendering to conditionally display button
- I made mobile-first design
- I used grid css for the mosaic layout
